A to-do list application built with JavaScript allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Here's a simple outline of how you can create one:

HTML Structure: Set up the basic structure of the to-do list in HTML, including an input field to add tasks, a button to submit tasks, and an unordered list (<ul>) to display tasks.

CSS Styling: Apply styles to make your to-do list visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript Functionality:

Add Task: Write a JavaScript function to add tasks to the list when the user submits a new task.
Remove Task: Implement functionality to remove tasks when the user clicks a delete button associated with each task.
Mark Task as Completed: Add the ability to mark tasks as completed by toggling a class or checkbox associated with each task.
Local Storage: Optionally, use local storage to persist tasks even when the page is refreshed.
Event Listeners: Attach event listeners to relevant HTML elements (e.g., submit button, delete buttons) to trigger the corresponding JavaScript functions.

Optional Features:

Edit Task: Allow users to edit existing tasks.
Priority Levels: Implement priority levels for tasks.
Filters: Add filters to view tasks based on status (completed, pending).
